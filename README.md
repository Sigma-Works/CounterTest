<h1>General Overview:</h1>
<br>
This project is about testing methods in JUnit Testing with assertEquals. We have a class, Counter, in which there are two methods named increment() and decrement(). We will
be focusing on testing these two methods. Both methods do what their names say, increment a counter/decrement a counter. 

We take these two methods and put them into another class that is solely dedicated to JUnit Testing called CounterTest. CounterTest imports libraries relevant to JUnit Testing
such as Assertions. We instantiate an object in this class and call the increment and decrement methods on it in different test methods. In each test method, we 
compare the intended output with the expected output using assertEquals. Through this process, we are able to effectively and successfully test our methods increment() and 
decrement() using JUnit testing in Java.

After running the file's contents, you should have been able to pass the two test cases for increment() and decrement() successfully.
